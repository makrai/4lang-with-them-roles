# 4lang-with-them-roles

4lang is a graph representation for the semantics of human language ([Kornai et
al 2015](https://hlt.bme.hu/hu/publ/Kornai_2015a), [Kov√°cs et al.
2022](https://hlt.bme.hu/en/publ/Kovacs_2022b)). The core of the system is a
set of manually defined words. Until 2016, the manual definitions marked the
positions of arguments within the definitions of argument-bearing words on a
thematic basis i.e. cross-lingual syntacto-semantic generalizations. Since
2019, [the definitions in the main repo of the
project](https://github.com/kornai/4lang/blob/master/4lang) changed. This repo
is for the maintenance of the early formalism.
